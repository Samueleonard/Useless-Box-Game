only have 1 level
when load level pressed, load only scene (save time + storage)
but parameters for robot would change between levels
so would have to be pulled from text file (or json?)

levelX.json 
read when scene loaded, pass level parameter on scene load? (load level with argument)
each level has different parameters, making levels harder
. robot speed
. levelup chance
. time limits
. switch amounts? hide/show switches depending on switch amounts
        each switch has a list of levels that it will appear on
        at start of level, check if level is included in the list, if it is, show switch, else hide
